            Welcome to my portfolio page!
            <p>
                I have had a career in education for thirteen years, and as much as I loved being involved with helping kids grow in their knowledge of not only business and technology education, but also of the world, I need a change. I have been coding casually for about twenty years, and had been teaching coding for about ten of those years. 
            <p>
                I have always dabbled in creating sprites, coding games, teaching application and web development, and, at this point in my life, I feel I am ready to code full-time. I want to create for more than just my own amusement. I want to develop websites, applications, programs, etc. for others to make use of and enjoy!
            </p>
            <p>
                As an educator, more specifically a Computer Science educator, I have honed my debugging skills and developed a new way of looking at and percieving a bit of code's purposes. In that knowledge I am able to refine the code to make it more efficient and streamlined.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have always felt that I could "see" the underlying code for any program or application I am using. I have that grasp and understanding of how, what, where, when, and why the code does what it does. I wish to put this skill to work in the creation of programs for others to understand and interpret.
